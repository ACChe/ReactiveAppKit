# ReactiveAppKit

ReactiveAppKit is a framework from ReactiveKit collection of frameworks that extends AppKit objects with bindings. Consult [ReactiveKit](https://github.com/ReactiveKit/ReactiveKit) documentation to learn how to work with the properties and streams it provides. 

All extensions are prefixed with _r_ so you can learn them on the fly as you work. Just start typing _.r_ on an instance of any AppKit object to see what's available.

ReactiveAppKit supports OS X 10.10 and later.

Initial version is kindly contributed by Tony Arnold (@tonyarnold). Thank you!
